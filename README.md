Description: This little app was used by creator in order to learn about how to work with mp3 files and image uploads. This was an attempt to create a very rough draft which will act as a precursor to a much nicer app that will be created as a capstone project.

What still be done?

- Handle errors appropriately when it comes to authentication. If a user with an account signs-in, redirect him to log-in and display message
- There are many other errors not handled as wanted
- Communication between accounts
- Better code organization
- Ability to add comments and rate songs
- With a rating system present it can be way easier to select trending songs
- Have a better database set-up, which includes recently created songs. This will allow to add another feature which is newest songs

- A lot more can be done after this as well
